To begin, choose the number of rounds (or press <enter> for infinite mode).
Then play against the computer. YOu can choose between R (rock), P (paper) or S (scissors).
The rules are as follows:
- Paper beats rock
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
Type <quit> to end the game at anytime.
